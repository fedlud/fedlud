## 🧠 Summary

I'm a Java Developer with over 4 years of experience in full-cycle software development — from idea to production. My focus is on building scalable and resilient systems, with deep involvement in microservice architecture, database optimization, and secure data handling.

I’ve worked in both greenfield and legacy environments, primarily in the medical and banking sectors. I’m proactive, communicative, and ready to both lead and support. I value clarity, efficiency, and collaboration in every project I join.
